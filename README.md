# Online shop backend - Tello
Welcome to the backend repository of the Online Shopping Application! This project serves as the foundation for an advanced and feature-rich online shopping platform. The backend is built using C#, Entity Framework, .NET 6, MSSql, Stripe, and Azure Storage, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for the application.

# Features
**User Authentication and Authorization:** The backend implements a secure user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring that only authorized users can access the application. This feature provides a seamless and secure login experience for customers and protects sensitive data.

**Payment Processing with Stripe:** The application is integrated with Stripe, a popular payment gateway, to facilitate secure and smooth payment transactions. Customers can confidently make purchases, knowing that their payment information is handled securely.

**Shopping Cart Management:** The backend includes a robust shopping cart system that allows customers to add, remove, and modify items in their cart. This feature ensures a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience, making it convenient for customers to manage their purchases.

**Admin Panel API Consumption:** The backend consumes external APIs to power the admin panel of the application. This integration enables efficient management of ecommerce operations, such as product management, inventory control, and order processing.
